Students are expected to select datasets that interest them (e.g., remote sensing data, historical energy consumption data from various countries, the distribution of significant earthquakes, global river nutrient fluxes, etc.). Each student will clean their datasets, analyze and explore the data, create visualizations, train a machine learning model, and narrate a story (i.e., interpret the data). Students will submit their Jupyter notebooks that contain R codes and analyses plus text narratives (i.e., computational notebooks). You can find out some computational notebook examples at [this site](https://agu.curve.space){target=_blank}. Students will also present a very brief (~5-minute) lightning-talk style overview of their project to the class. Presentation duration is subject to change. Students are highly encouraged to consult with the instructor when selecting their project topics."

    "\n",
    "### Important Deadlines\n",
    "\n",
    "Add Deadline: Tuesday, January 21, 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "Academic/Financial Drop Deadline: Monday, February 3, 2025\n",

    "Withdrawal Deadline: Tuesday, April 15, 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Syllabus Language\n",
    "\n",
    "As a pre-eminent and inclusive student-focused research institution, Syracuse University considers academic integrity at the forefront of learning, serving as a core value and guiding pillar of education. Syracuse University’s Academic Integrity Policy provides students with the necessary guidelines to complete academic work with integrity throughout their studies. Students are required to uphold both course-specific and university-wide academic integrity expectations such as crediting your sources, doing your own work, communicating honestly, and supporting academic integrity. The full Syracuse University Academic Integrity Policy can be found by visiting class.syr/edu, selecting, “Academic Integrity,” and “Expectations and Policy.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Upholding Academic Integrity includes the protection of faculty’s intellectual property. Students should not upload, distribute, or share instructors’ course materials, including presentations, assignments, exams, or other evaluative materials without permission. Using websites that charge fees or require uploading of course material (e.g., Chegg, Course Hero) to obtain exam solutions or assignments completed by others, which are then presented as your own violates academic integrity expectations in this course and may be classified as a Level 3 violation. All academic integrity expectations that apply to in-person assignments, quizzes, and exams also apply online.\n",
    "\n",
    "Students found in violation of the policy are subject to grade sanctions determined by the course instructor and non-grade sanctions determined by the School or College where the course is offered. Students may not drop or withdraw from courses in which they face a suspected violation. Any established violation in this course may result in course failure regardless of violation level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Artificial Intelligence Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the assignments in this course and our specified learning outcomes, the full use of artificial intelligence as a tool, ***with disclosure and citation***, is permitted in this course. Students do not need to ask permission to use these tools before starting an assignment or exam, but they must explicitly and fully indicate which tools were used and describe how they were used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Academic Integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "Syracuse University’s Academic Integrity Policy reflects the high value that we, as a university community, place on honesty in academic work. The policy defines our expectations for academic honesty and holds students accountable for the integrity of all work they submit. Students should understand that it is their responsibility to learn about course-specific expectations, as well as about university-wide academic integrity expectations. The policy governs appropriate citation and use of sources, the integrity of work submitted in exams and assignments, and the veracity of signatures on attendance sheets and other verification of participation in class activities. The policy also prohibits students from submitting the same work in more than one class without receiving written authorization in advance from both instructors. Under the policy, students found in violation are subject to grade sanctions determined by the course instructor and non-grade sanctions determined by the School or College where the course is offered as described in the Violation and Sanction Classification Rubric. Syracuse University students are required to read an online summary of the University’s academic integrity expectations and provide an electronic signature agreeing to abide by them twice a year during pre-term check- in on MySlice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Violation and Sanction Classification Rubric establishes recommended guidelines for the determination of grade penalties by faculty and instructors, while also giving them discretion to select the grade penalty they believe most suitable, including course failure, regardless of violation level. Any established violation in this course may result in course failure regardless of violation level.\n",
    "\n",
    "All academic integrity expectations that apply to in-person quizzes and exams also apply to online quizzes and exams. In this course, all work submitted for quizzes and exams must be yours alone. ***Discussing quiz or exam questions with anyone during the quiz or exam period violates academic integrity expectations for this course.*** Using websites that charge fees or require uploading of course material (e.g., Chegg, Course Hero) to obtain exam solutions or assignments completed by others and present the work as your own violates academic integrity expectations in this course.\n",

    "### Copyright Infringement and Electronic Course Materials\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes and other information (such as exam reviews, exam questions, etc.) made available electronically through Blackboard or email are intended only for the use of students currently enrolled in this course and are not to be disseminated or posted to other websites. They are for the sole use of students currently enrolled in this class and may be subject to copyright. If you take materials provided for this class electronically and then post them to the web in return for monetary compensation, you may be violating copyright, particularly if you include images and PowerPoint slides provided by the professor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Students in Need of Disability-Related Academic Accommodations\n",
    "\n",
    "Syracuse University values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to a climate of mutual respect and full participation.  There may be aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in barriers to your inclusion and full participation in this course.  I invite any student to contact me to discuss strategies and/or accommodations (academic adjustments) that may be essential to your success and to collaborate with the Center for Disability Resources (CDR) in this process. If you would like to discuss disability-accommodations or register with CDR, please visit [Center for Disability Resources](https://disabilityservices.syr.edu/){target=_blank}. Please call (315) 443-4498 or email disabilityresources@syr.edu for more detailed information. The CDR is responsible for coordinating disability-related academic accommodations and will work with the student to develop an access plan. Academic accommodations, such as exam administration, are not provided retroactively; therefore, planning for accommodations as early as possible is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Faith Tradition Observances\n",
    "\n",
    "SU’s religious observances policy, found at [SU website](https://policies.syr.edu/policies/university-governance-ethics-integrity-and-legal-compliance/religious-observances-policy/){target=_blank}, recognizes the diversity of faiths represented in the campus community and protects the rights of students, faculty, and staff to observe religious holy days according to their tradition. Syracuse University does not set aside non-instructional days for any religious holiday. Students must notify instructors by the end of the second week of classes when they will be observing their religious holiday(s). Students will have access to an online notification form through MySlice for two weeks beginning on the first day of class. Once I have been notified of your intention to be absent for a religious observance, I will work with you directly to find a way to accommodate your absence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Absences and Associated Missed Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Excuses for class absences for medical reasons will be given only if such absences are advised by a health care provider at the Health Center, based on clinical findings and prescribed treatment recommendations. Excused notes will not be given solely to confirm a visit to the Health Center. For complete details on excuse notes, visit this [[SU website]](https://ese.syr.edu/bewell/policies-and-procedures-barnes-center-at-the-arch-syracuse-university/){target=_blank}.\n",

    "### Discrimination or Harassment\n",
    "\n",
