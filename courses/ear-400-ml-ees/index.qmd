# Course description

At this end of the course - [Environmental Aqueous Geochemistry](http://jaywen.com){target=_blank}, students will be able to describe various concepts of programming, apply geospatial analysis and machine learning techniques to address real-world earth and environmental science questions, and interpret model outputs. The specific learning outcomes of the course are:

1. Read and write data using standard formats
2. Utilize modern coding environment R to perform scientific programing
3. Wrangle and explore data effectively
4. Perform advanced data visualization
5. Write efficient code to perform earth and environmental science data manipulation and geospatial analysis
6. Apply machine learning techniques to address real-world earth and environmental science questions
7. Design and complete a project using real-world data
