I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in [the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences](http://earthsciences.syr.edu){target="_blank"} at [Syracuse University](https://www.syracuse.edu){target="_blank"}. My major research interests are studying the water and carbon cycles within the coupled human and natural system at varying temporal and spatial scales using both data mining (big data) and case study (small data) approaches. Since joining the faculty in 2020, I designed, built, and direct the Syracuse University Hydrogeochemistry And eNvironmental Data Sciences (HANDS) Research Laboratory. In the HANDS group, concentrations of water quality parameters, and isotopic compositions of selected elements (e.g., oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen) and noble gases (i.e., He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) are determined by ion chromatography, optical emission spectrometry, water isotope analyzer, and mass spectrometry. In addition, the emerging machine learning and geostatistical tools are developed and utilized to assess the interplay between water and carbon cycles in Earth-Surface systems, as well as to investigate the regulation of these cycles by human activities (e.g., energy extraction and urbanization) and natural processes. I teach a variety of water-related and data science-related courses for both undergraduate and graduate students including Introduction to Data Analysis (EAR 200), Water and Our Environment (EAR 205), Hydrogeology (EAR 401/601), and Environmental Aqueous Geochemistry (EAR 419/619).
