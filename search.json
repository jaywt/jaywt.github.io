The accommodations are newly constructed and comprise of 22,000 square feet, including core laboratories and individual faculty laboratories. The core laboratories include a microbiology, soil, 3 analytical, water, acid wash, trace metals and state of the art Class 10,000 clean room. In addition, there is a radioactive isotope laboratory, dark room, 3 constant temperature rooms, cold room, computer lab for students equipped with personal computers and printers, and a teaching laboratory. The facilities have been designed with versatility required for interdisciplinary research.\nAnalytical and Technical Services (A&TS) at SUNY ESF: A&TS has developed an extensive portfolio of chemical analysis methods and capabilities in computer and instrument repair, electronic design and chemical stockroom services to complement the academic activities of the ESF community. Provided services include nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GS/MS), liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS), instrument and equipment repair and fabrication, inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), chemical and laboratory apparatus stockroom, and polymer rheology and mechanical properties.\n\n\n\n\nResearch Computing Resources\n\nMultiple high performance workstations for the WEN group use only\nData Centers: Syracuse University host a state-of-the-art data center, including 6,000 square feet of floor space and 450 kilowatts of power and cooling. It is now the main center for production computing resources, marrying research and administrative computing interests. The internal data center network is a mix of 10 and 40 Gigabit connectivity, with redundant connections to all hosts and network components whenever possible. The data center supports a robust virtual private cloud where 98% of campus servers have been consolidated. The data center is connected to the campus network and secondary data center via two bundles of geographically diverse, 144 strand fiber paths. This can be and has been used to provide direct connectivity between a researcher’s campus building and the hosted area in the primary data center.\nAcademic Virtual Hosting Environment (AVHE): The Academic Virtual Hosting Environment (AVHE) provides a virtual computing cloud to the Syracuse University research community, lowering the bar of entry for small to medium sized research efforts. The AVHE platform provides two Petabytes of storage, 1000 cores, and 25TB of memory for research use. The AVHE uses virtualization to provide flexibility and hardware sharing to allow multiple researchers to operate on an underlying server and storage infrastructure.  This lower bar of entry and flexibility provides an environment that supports both traditional and non-traditional computational research.  The AVHE supports Windows and Linux operating systems with a dynamic resource allocation model for easy scaling and configuration. Beyond supporting individual workloads, another use case for the AVHE is building small to medium sized virtualized research computing clusters, reducing the need for researchers to build and maintain small physical clusters. The AVHE utilizes the abilities of virtualization to provide high availability, which automatically migrates workload to alternate resources in the case of physical server failure.  Backup services within the AVHE are a standard service provided to researchers.\nCrush: Crush is a medium scale virtualized research cloud. It is designed to be allocated for compute intensive work and to be used in tandem with the AVHE where the data and work scheduling infrastructure are maintained. A primary use case for Crush is the provisioning of a “cluster within a cluster” providing access to dedicated, customized compute nodes for high-performance and high-throughput computing. Nodes within Crush provide a diverse set of configurations including high density processing power, high speed disk I/O, and high-speed networking. Currently Crush consists of 25,000 cores and 150 Terabytes of memory."

Interested students should have a background in hydrogeology, geochemistry, or relevant fields and a motivation to learn programming.\nNoble gas geochemistry track: Students will apply noble gases as a dating and tracing tool for fluid and solid samples. Students will be trained in noble gas geochemistry with respect to both laboratory and data analysis skills. Students will conduct experimental noble gas work in shallow and deep groundwater, natural gas, and/or rock samples.\nExternal Graduate Student Fellowships I am happy to work with interested candidates to collaboratively develop proposals for external graduate student fellowships, e.g., NSF GRFP."

    "text": "I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Syracuse University. My major research interests are studying the water and carbon cycles within the coupled human and natural system at varying temporal and spatial scales using both data mining (big data) and case study (small data) approaches. Since joining the faculty in 2020, I designed, built, and direct the Syracuse University Hydrogeochemistry And eNvironmental Data Sciences (HANDS) Research Laboratory. In the HANDS group, concentrations of water quality parameters, and isotopic compositions of selected elements (e.g., oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen) and noble gases (i.e., He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) are determined by ion chromatography, optical emission spectrometry, water isotope analyzer, and mass spectrometry. In addition, the emerging machine learning and geostatistical tools are developed and utilized to assess the interplay between water and carbon cycles in Earth-Surface systems, as well as to investigate the regulation of these cycles by human activities (e.g., energy extraction and urbanization) and natural processes. I teach a variety of water-related and data science-related courses for both undergraduate and graduate students including Introduction to Data Analysis (EAR 200), Water and Our Environment (EAR 205), Hydrogeology (EAR 401/601), and Environmental Aqueous Geochemistry (EAR 419/619)."
